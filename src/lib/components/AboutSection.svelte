	<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a motivated software developer and Fanshawe College CPA/2 graduate that
    is eager to get into the industry. After starting the Computer Programmer / Analyst
    program in 2019 I fell in love with coding and haven't stopped since. I love diving
    into new technologies and learning new ways to build cool software.
    <br />
    <br />
    I develop on ubuntu linux running i3 as my window manager and using neovim
    as my editor. This has sparked tons of learning experiences and an interest
    in writing bash scripts to customize my i3 environment and create efficient 
    development workflows. I have also been very interested in configuring my
    neovim environment with lua and various plugins to turn my editor setup
    into a fun ongoing interactive experience. I have lots of experience with
    web development using frameworks demonstrated in my projects, along with a 
    core understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main passions in my
    4 years of learning have been mostly C++ and web development, I enjoy 
    writing tools to streamline tasks, and writing applications
    to solve problems I come across as a developer and end user.
    <br />
    <br />
    I would love to discuss my passions and skills further and show you what I'm made of.
